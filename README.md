# XPKEYGEN-JS

This is a repo for a fixed-up version of [This website](http://pastehtml.com/view/5ucd3ts.html) (That doesn't work anymore), which is a Windows XP Keygen
It's based on [This C++ Source Code](https://github.com/TheMCHK/WindowsXPKg) but ported to JavaScript, so it can work on your web browser
This isn't written by me, i just mirrored the website and fixed the HTTPS errors that PasteHTML was giving.
